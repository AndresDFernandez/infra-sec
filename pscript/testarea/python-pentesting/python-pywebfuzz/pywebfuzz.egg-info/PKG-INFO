Description: pywebfuzz is a Python module to assist in the
        identification of vulnerabilities in web applications through brute force methods.
        The module does this by providing common testing values along with generators and
        other utilities that would be helpful when fuzzing web applications.
        
        pywebfuzz has the fuzzdb project implemented in Python classes for ease of use.
        
        fuzzdb is just a collection of values for testing. The point is to provide many of
        the values of the fuzzdb project cleaned up and available through Python classes
        and namespaces. This makes it easier to use these values in your own test cases.
        Effort was made to match the names up similarly to the folders and values files
        from the fuzzdb project. This effort can sometimes make for some ugly looking
        namespaces. This balance was struck so that familiarity with the fuzzdb project
        would cross over in to the Python code. The exceptions come in with the replacement
        of hyphens with underscores.
